I created this app at the end of my first week learning Javascript at Makers Academy.

It is a single page webapp with a thermostat graphic: the thermostat settings can be adjusted in the UI and this speaks to the backend to change the temperature. The app also makes an external API call to get weather information from major cities worldwide.
